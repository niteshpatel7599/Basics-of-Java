Did you know that GraalVM Enterprise has earned the support from popular framework vendors like Spring and Micronaut. The technology improves the build-time processing for modern, high-performance, cloud-native applications. It enables fast startup time and low memory consumption that make it an ideal choice when compiling applications for the cloud, in containers, or as serverless functions. GraalVM Enterprise is a high-performance JDK that speeds up the performance of Java and JVM-based applications. It improves peak throughput and comes with 24x7 Oracle support, all on OCI at no additional cost.

CloudWorld and JavaOne will be starting soon. There are Keynotes, Learning Sessions, Hands-on-labs, and on-demand broadcasts. You can search through the Session Catalog and build your own GraalVM agenda, but I want to highlight a few sessions that will help jumpstart your cloud native project on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). There are several keynotes, including  Mahesh Thiagarajanâ€™s (SVP Security and Developer Platform) presentation; he introduces OCI appdev strategies and roadmap plans that will help developers develop better cloud native applications.
